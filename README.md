## Functional and Usability Testing of PixelsSuite

### Overview
This project contains the automated and manual test artifacts for the functional and usability testing of [PixelsSuite](https://www.pixelssuite.com/). A software testing project developed for the Information Technology Project Management (ITPM) module, focusing on functional and usability testing of the PixelsSuite application.

### Project Structure
- `image_preview_test.py`: Playwright script to automate the preview functionality test.
- `execution_results.csv`: Results of the automated test execution.
- `Manual Test Cases for Option 2.xlsx`: Excel file containing 35 manual test scenarios (36 total including the automated one).
- `results/`: Directory containing screenshots of the automated test execution.
- `sample.png`: Sample image used for the automated test.
- `generate_excel.py`: Utility script used to generate the manual test cases.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or 3.12
- Google Chrome browser (or Chromium installed via Playwright)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or extract the project folder.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd test_automation_ui
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -U pip
   pip install playwright openpyxl
   playwright install
   ```

### Running the Automated Test
To run the automated preview functionality test for the "Image format conversion" feature:
```bash
python image_preview_test.py --url "https://www.pixelssuite.com/convert-to-png" --slow-mo-ms 2000
```
The script will:
1. Navigate to the specified URL.
2. Upload the `sample.png` file.
3. Verify if the preview is displayed.
4. Save a screenshot in the `results/` folder.
5. Record the result in `execution_results.csv`.

### Master Automation (Advanced)
A master script `automate_all.py` is included that automates all 10 features mentioned in the assignment.
To run the full suite:
```bash
python automate_all.py
```
This will generate `all_automated_execution_results.csv` and store all screenshots in the `all_results/` folder.

### Manual Test Cases
The `Manual Test Cases for Option 2.xlsx` file contains 50 scenarios covering 10 features.
1. Document conversion
2. PDF editing
3. Image resizing
4. Cropping
5. Compression
6. Image format conversion
